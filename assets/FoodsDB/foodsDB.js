                title: `What Is Bopis?`,
                content: `As we mentioned prior, bopis is essentially slices of pig lungs with other ingredients that give it that tart and spicy taste. It is said that bopis has Spanish origins, though there doesn’t seem to be any record of the meaning of the word in the original language. Regardless, the same vibrant flavors you expect of any Spanish-influenced dish are definitely present here! The type of bopis dishes are endless; some opt for simply pork lungs, while others go for the heart, too. Others even use beef! Whatever you prefer, this meat is sautéed and stir-fried until crispy, giving you that extra layer of texture in each bite. It’s delicious!
    
    You usually mix the meat with a combination of carrots, onions, and tomatoes. Ginger, annatto powder, and Thai chili peppers are what give you that additional flavor you’ve come to know and love in bopis. Aromatic and addictive, the scent of this dish is only a teaser to the piquancy you and your loved ones are sure to enjoy. Like another Kapampangan favorite, sisig, some opt to serve bopis on a sizzling plate. This adds to the dish’s crunchiness and makes it more exciting — especially when you serve it with rice!
    
    The combination of spicy and sour isn’t one you often see executed as well as it is in a perfect plate of bopis. This Kapampangan favorite is an excellent mesh of two seemingly opposite flavors. From the hot and spicy to the zesty and tart, each bite packs a punch that’ll keep you coming back for more. Whether you’re eating it as a standalone or with cups (and cups) of rice, bopis is more than just a staple — it’s loved across the Philippines!
    
    Big, bold, bright — these three b words encapsulate bopis perfectly. And when you want to give it a try, you might have to be a little brave, too. After all — did you know that this hearty dish is made with pork lungs? Like many other Filipino dishes, this recipe knows not to waste any single part of the precious pig! While you might scrunch your nose up at the notion of eating pork lungs, don’t worry! Tap into your adventurous side, and you might even find your next favorite meal. Bopis is the perfect place to start on your daring culinary experience.`,

                title: `Tips for Cooking Bopis`,
                content: `It’s very important that you’ve cleaned your pork lungs properly before continuing your cooking process. This ensures that you can enjoy this scrumptious dish as safely as you possibly can! Another important step is ensuring that your organs are tender enough to chew on, too. You can achieve this by putting your pig parts in a pot of boiling water. Couple this with bay leaves and sibot, and your lungs are sure to not only be tender — but tasty, too!
    
    Equally important is ensuring that you have just enough vinegar, and that you don’t stir it in right away. Do this, and your dish may end up more sour than it should, completely forsaking the spicy. Wait a few moments before stirring, or even pour the water in first. This will guarantee that your dish is perfectly balanced, as it should be.
    
    Armed with these tips, making bopis is sure to be a piece of cake! Read on to find out the easy steps to this Filipino classic.`,

                title: `Bopis Recipe`,
                content: `Boil 8 cups of water in a large pot alongside 5 dried bay leaves and 25 grams of sibot. Then, put in three pounds of pig’s lungs and let it boil for about an hour. When your time is up, remove the lungs from the pot, letting them cool down before slicing them. Take your small pieces and set them aside for later. Meanwhile, in another pot, heat cooking oil and sauté garlic, onion, and ginger.
    
    Now, add in the lungs you had diced prior. Do this when your onions softened, and cook these together for about three minutes. Vinegar goes in next; use five tablespoons, and cook for two minutes. After this, pour 2 ½ cups of water into the pot and once again bring it to a boil. Toss in your Knorr Pork Cube and another 5 bay leaves, and stir. Cover your pot and bring your heat between low to medium. The goal is to get your liquid to evaporate by half before continuing to make your bopis.
    
    Did your liquid lessen? Now you can add in your carrot, chili peppers, and annatto powder. For 3 minutes, cook your bopis and mix thoroughly. Don’t forget to season with ground black pepper and patis (or fish sauce) to taste!
    
    When you’re happy with the end product, it’s time to serve your bopis! Transfer your dish to a serving plate, and share and enjoy! Whether it’s with rice or a cold one, your bopis will be a smashing success. Let us know what you and your family think of this jewel!`,

        description: `Kare Kare is a type of Filipino stew with a rich and thick peanut sauce. It is a popular dish in the Philippines served during special occasions. The traditional recipe is composed of ox tail. There are instances wherein both ox tripe and tail are used. The vegetable components of the dish are string beans, eggplant, bok choy, and banana blossoms. Lightly browned toasted ground rice is used to thicken the sauce.
    
    Palayok or clay pot is used to cook this dish. It also functions as the serving bowl at the same time.The best way to eat kare-kare is to pair it with plain white rice. Bagoong alamang or fermented shrimp paste completes the dish by providing flavor. Simply combine a spoonful of rice and kare-kare with a small portion of bagoong and enjoy!`,

    Prepare the meat by boiling it along with chopped onion. This will make it tender while providing flavor at the same time. Oxtail needs to be very tender for best results. It takes around 3 hours to boil when cooking using the traditional method. A quicker way is to use a pressure cooker. It cuts the cooking time by more than half.
    
    The peanut sauce can make or break your dish. It is important to have the proper ratio of ingredients to be able to achieve the ideal consistency of the sauce. It should not be too thick or very thin. I use both peanut butter and crushed peanuts to make the sauce. It provides a rich flavor to it. Annatto seeds make the color of the sauce reddish. You will need to extract the color from the seed by soaking it in warm water for around 12 minutes. The colored water is used to make the dish, not the seed. Discard the seed after use. Thicken the sauce with toasted ground rice.
    
    Vegetable is an important component of kare kare. It can be cooked with the meat or it can be added when serving the dish. I opted to cook the vegetables separately by sautéing with garlic.`,

        description: `Pork Igado is an Ilocano stew made of strips of liver and pork tenderloin braised in a tangy and savory soy sauce-vinegar mixture along with spices such as garlic, onions, and bay leaves.
    
    Other innards such as kidney and heart are also common additions as well as green peas and bell peppers. Although this pork and liver dish is usually associated with pork menudo due to a few common ingredients, it’s actually closer in taste to adobo and very similar to the Kapampangan kilayin.`,

                title: `Origins of Igado`,
                content: `This is a unique spiced dish made with a variety of seasonings, as well as a couple of vegetables to complement the meat ingredients. It is also pretty popular for its use of pig innards, as I mentioned earlier. But we will go deeper into the components for this dish later on. 
    
    Studies show that Igado was influenced by Spanish cuisine, which you might already be able to tell from its name. “Higado” means liver in Spanish, and some say that Filipinos heard it as “Igado,” hence its name today. `,

                title: `What matches Igado`,
                content: `You can choose whatever side dish you like for Igado. But because it’s pretty flavorful and rich, you may want to opt for food with lighter flavor. After all, you don’t want to overpower the already tasty mix of flavors in Igado. This is why the recipe is well-known as a great “ulam” or viand to have with a fresh batch of rice.
    
    It is also pretty common to eat this with drinks as it is a perfect “pulutan” dish! Just like Sisig, this tasty dish helps to offset the rough effect of alcohol, and leaves you reaching for more after every bite. It may not be as famous as the likes of Crispy Pata, but it is definitely something to note for your next drinking session. You can expect a delightfully salty and sour dish to keep you energized as you catch up with friends or family.`,

        description: `Longsilog is a traditional Filipino dish that's served for breakfast. The dish and its name consist of a combination of longganisa sausage, sinangag (garlic rice), and itlog (fried eggs). The Filipino-style sausages (pork, garlic, vinegar, salt, sugar) are boiled and fried in their own fat until crispy, while the garlic rice and the eggs are fried in oil.
    
    When served, longsilog is traditionally accompanied by freshly sliced tomatoes or cucumbers.`,

Without even laying eyes on it, longsilog’s smell wafting through your home is enough to drag even the sleepiest out of bed. Its tantalizing aroma and humble yet comforting appearance, however, aren’t what make this dish special. In fact, it’s longsilog’s simple yet flavorful taste that is the star of the show!`,

                title: `How to Make Longsilog`,
                content: `Start making your longsilog by heating 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Once that oil gets hot, fry 2 pieces of eggs. We’re going for a sunny side, slightly over-easy egg, so that yolk is still runny when you slice it open later. Yum! (Feel free, however, to cook your eggs however you’d like.) Once you’ve cooked your egg long enough, remove it from the pan and set it aside.
    
    Then, it’s time to add in your remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. The next part of your longsilog to cook is the longanisa itself! Fry half a pound of skinless longanisa in your pan for about a minute and a half. This should be enough time for the outer part of your sausages to turn a light brown. Pour in half a cup of water and bring it to a boil. Let it evaporate, then fry the longanisa in the remaining oil until you’ve cooked it inside out! Remove it from the pan and set it aside.
    
    That’s 2 of the 3 components of longsilog you’ve already handled! The last component is the easiest –– sinangag, or garlic rice! Using the remaining oil from the longanisa, cook your crushed garlic in the pan until it starts to slightly brown. Add in your 4 cups of leftover rice and stir fry it for about 3 minutes. Season your sinangag with salt and pepper to taste.
    
    Transfer all your longsilog’s components –– the longanisa, the eggs, and garlic rice –– to a plate! If you like, you can even fill a bowl with spicy vinegar as a dipping sauce for your meat. And just like that, breakfast is ready!`,

Dredge the banana in sugar until completely coated. You may use either brown or white sugar. Arrange the banana on a lumpia wrapper and place the jackfruit slices on top of the banana. Secure the filling by wrapping. Refer to the video below on how to wrap turon. Perform this step until all the bananas are completely consumed.
    
    The next step is to fry the banana lumpia until golden brown. However, there is an extra step to do in order to achieve the glaze on the outer part. The secret is to first pour the remaining sugar in hot oil. Wait for the sugar to melt completely, and then start to fry the wrapped bananas in batches. The caramel (melted sugar) should automatically stick on the wrapper as you fry.Remove the fried turon from the pan, and then let the excess oil drip. Let is cool down for 5 minutes before eating.`,

                title: `What is the difference between Leche flan and creme caramel?`,
                content: `It is a classic Filipino dish that was adopted from the creme caramel of European origins. However, there is a difference between these desserts. Leche flan, for one, does not use cream. And it mainly relies on evaporated milk and condensed milk for the creamy flavor. You also use condensed milk to add a level of sweetness aside from the sugar in the recipe. Furthermore, creme caramel tastes lighter. While Leche flan, at its best and most authentic, usually tastes a bit heavier, with a rich flavor.
    
    You make this with the process of baking caramel on the bottom of a custard mold. And it is a sweet custard dessert that leaves you wanting more. This is because other than the fact that it is delectably inviting in its rich, sugary flavor, it is traditionally served in a llanera. And while this oblong metal container is very convenient for the baking process, its small size often results in careful division of the dessert among a group of people who want to share the popular custard.`,

                title: `Where did Leche flan actually come from?`,
                content: `In the 1500s, the Spanish colonized the Philippines. Because of their rule spanning for about 300 years, the Spanish influences had permeated themselves in many parts of Philippine culture. And this, of course, includes the cooking.
    
    During the Spanish colonization, several Catholic missionaries came over to build churches in the Philippines. And they largely used egg whites to build msot of these churches. This is because they can be a strong adhesive when mixed with quicklime. But because of the widespread usage of egg whites, they had to find ways to utilize the egg yolks left behind.
    
    Of course, one of the essential ingredients of a leche flan are the egg yolks. And this was how the dish was born. With leche meaning milk, the original term for the dessert was actually Leche de flan. The direct translation for this was “flan milk”. With time, they shortened the term to leche flan. And the chilled custard with caramelized sugar became even more popular with time.
    
    Soon, the American colonization took place, which also brought about some changes for the Leche flan. Because of the arrival of canned food products, such as canned condensed milk and canned evaporated milk, most recipes now call for these ingredients strongly to create a classic Leche flan. This resulted in the largely rich, and dense taste and texture of the dessert we now know and love.`,

                title: `How to Cook Leche Flan`,
                content: `Making your own leche flan can be easy if you follow the recipe below and watch the cooking video. Start by beating the egg yolks in a mixing bowl. You can do it the manual way using a fork or use a hand mixer or a stand mixer. Ensure that the eggs are smooth. Gradually add the milk. Start with the condensed milk followed by the fresh milk and vanilla extract. Continue to beat all the ingredients in the bowl until these are well blended. Set this aside for the meantime while you prepare for the next process.
    
    Grab your llanera or baking pan and place some sugar on it. Heat it over a stove top while holding the pan. Wear oven gloves to protect your hands. You will need to heat it until the sugar melts and turns into caramel. Once the happens, spread the caramel evenly on the llanera or mold that you are using. Slowly add the mixture into each mold and then cover the mold with foil.
    
    The last process is to steam the mold. Simply arrange all the mold in a steamer and steam for a good 30 minutes or so until the mixture turns into yummy flan. At this point, you will decide if you want to dig in right away, or let it cook down a bit.`,

                title: `What is Chicken Adobo`,
                content: `A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.

Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.

What really sets adobo apart is the presence of soy sauce in its marinade. While vinegar has a pungent aroma and a very distinctly sour taste, soy sauce is on both the sweeter and saltier side. A staple in any Asian household, soy sauce (or toyo) definitely helps in bringing out chicken adobo’s savory taste.

(Here’s a fun fact: did you know that there are different kinds of soy sauce? In Japan especially, there are five different kinds of soy sauce that each have their own unique flavors and uses. The most common one you’ll find in markets is dark soy sauce, or koikuchi. With a deeper color than most other types, dark soy sauce is packed with flavor –– perfect for your chicken adobo!)

Adobo also contains dry bay leaves in its recipe. Although you aren’t to eat them whole, bay leaves lend their subtle, deep flavors to this umami dish. It may not be the star of the show, but your chicken adobo wouldn’t be complete without it. However, you can choose to substitute this herb with basil if you can’t find it at stores.`,

                content: `The famous Chicken Adobo originated in the Philippines. The dish is prepared using the Inadobo style of cooking. It means cooking meat or seafood with vinegar and mostly soy sauce. It is a popular method during the olden days when refrigerators and freezers were not yet available because vinegar helps extend the shelf life of food. Another popular variation is pork adobo using pork belly.`,

                title: `How to Cook Chicken Adobo`,
                content: `Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it.

Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.

The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.

Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.

Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.

Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.`,
